Documentation and Approach

1) Establish rough steps to get to goal of completing this project
  1) Decided to use angular given the single page orientation of the website. First thing would be to get the content repeating using a controller and simply have it display. Gain Functionality
  2) Once the content is displaying and behaving normally, style the content using normalize and bootsrap and leverage the heavier CSS workload there. Begin to space and get the content to at the very least look tasteful.
  3) Next is to ensure that iframes / links / font / spacing begin to come together
  4) Next add new responsive design (filter and more button).
  5) Fix functionality and response. Ensure the site is behaving as intended.
  6) Polish and think of ways to improve on the product.
